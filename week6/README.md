# CMEECourseWork Week6
## Brief description
The week6 directory is organized with code, data, results, and sandbox. There are some data files in the data directory. 
The sandbox directory and results directory are used to store test scripts and results for the scripts in the code directory, respectively.
The code directory contains seven important R-scripts about Genomics and Bioinformatics.
Before running the scripts, vegan and ggplot2 packages are requested to be installed.

## Languages
The language used in week6 is R.


## Dependencies
For the week6 section, vegan and ggplot2 packages need to be installed before running the Rscripts.

## Installation
Packages can be easily built and shared by users through cran.r-project.org. A package can be installed by using the install.packages() command. In Ubuntu, the bash terminal can also be adopted to install a package by typing "sudo apt install r-cran-package-name".

## Project structure and Usage
The week6 part includes code, data, results, and sandbox. There are seven R scripts in the code directory.
+ The example_01.R script is for the practical on allele and genotype frequencies. 
+ The example_02.R script is for the practical on genetic drift, mutation and divergence. 
+ The example_03.R script is for the practical on coalescence theory.
+ The example_04.R script is for the practical on population subdivision and demographic inferences.
+ The coalescence.R script is about the probability distribution of TMRCA.
+ The lectures_drift_mutation.R script is about genetic drift and mutations.
+ The TeachingScript.R script is a teaching script.

All the scripts can be easily run with the source command and the correct script name.
