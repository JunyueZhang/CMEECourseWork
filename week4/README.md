# CMEECourseWork Week4
## Brief description
The week4 directory is organized with code, data, results, and sandbox. There are some data files in the data directory. 
The sandbox directory and results directory are used to store test scripts and results for the scripts in the code directory, respectively.
The code directory contains 13 Rscripts about Statistics in R.
Before running the scripts, there are some packages requested to be installed: lme4, dplyr, ggplot2, and WebPower.

## Languages
The language used in week4 is R.


## Dependencies
For the week4 section, there are some useful R packages such as tidyverse needed to be installed. Requiring tidyverse will load the core tidyverse packages: ggplot2, for data visualisation; dplyr, for data manipulation; tidyr, for data tidying. To be more specific,  lme4, dplyr, ggplot2, and WebPower these packages need to be installed before running the Rscripts.

## Installation
Packages can be easily built and shared by users through cran.r-project.org. A package can be installed by using the install.packages() command. In Ubuntu, the bash terminal can also be adopted to install a package by typing "sudo apt install r-cran-package-name".

## Project structure and Usage
The week4 part includes code, data, results, and sandbox. There are 13 R scripts in the code directory.
+ The SWS01.R script is about basic statistics in R. 
+ The SWS02.R script is about z-scores and z-distribution.
+ The SWS03.R script is about different data types.
+ The SWS04.R script is about precision and standard errors.
+ The SWS05.R script is about comparing means.
+ The SWS06.R script is about statistical	power	tests.
+ The SWS07.R script is about simple linear functions.
+ The SWS08.R script is about linear models.
+ The SWS09.R script is about linear models with one predictor.
+ The SWS10.R script is about variance and covariance.
+ The SWS11.R script is about fitting models in R.
+ The SWS12.R script is about ANOVA and repeatability.
+ The SWS13.R script is about repeatability with linear mixed models.
All the scripts can be easily run with the source command and the correct script name.
