# CMEECourseWork Week2
## Brief description
The week2 directory is organized with code, data, results, sandbox, README.md, and .gitignore. There are a few data files downloaded from the [TheMulQuaBio repository](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio) in the data directory. 
The sandbox directory includes several test files.
The code directory contains a number of important python scripts for the practicals in [Python I chapter](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/05-Python_I.html#practicals).
There are some python packages needed to be imported to run the scripts: pickle, csv, sys, and doctest.

## Languages
The language used in week2 is python.

## Dependencies
There are many useful python packages available in standard libraries, and they can be explicitly installed using "sudo apt install python-packagename". For week2 section, pickle, csv, sys, and doctest packages need to be installed. 

## Installation
Details for Python packages can be found on the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). 

## Project structure and Usage
The week2 part includes code, data, results, sandbox. There are some python scripts in the code directory.
+ The script lc1.py can create three different lists containing the latin names, common names and mean body masses for each species in birds, respectively.
+ The script lc2.py can create a list of month, rainfall tuples where the amount of rain was greater than 100 mm and just month names where the amount of rain was less than 50 mm. 
+ The script tuple.py can print latin name, common name, mass of birds on a separate line or output block by species. 
+ The script dictionary.py can populate a dictionary called taxa_dic derived from taxa so that it maps order names to sets of taxa.
+ The script cfexercises1.py has six useful functions to implement different calculations.
+ The script align_seqs.py can take the DNA sequences as an input from a single csv file and save the best alignment along with its corresponding score in a single text file. 
+ The script scope.py shows several examples about understanding global variables and local variables.
+ The script debugme.py expands the previous debugme.py example to understand how this works.
+ The script control_flow.py shows some functions exemplifying the use of control statements.
+ The script loops.py shows some loops examples.
+ The script basic_io3.py saves an object (even complex) for later use and loads the data again.
+ The script oaks.py uses both for loops and list comprehensions.
+ The script using_name.py helps to understand [__name__ == "__main__"].
+ The script test_control_flow.py shows some functions with embedded tests exemplifying the use of control statements.
+ The script sysargv.py helps to understand sys.argv in a practical way.
+ The script cfexercises2.py includes six functions of loops and conditionals combined.
+ The script basic_io1.py opens a file for reading, use "implicit" for loop.
+ The script basic_io2.py saves the elements of a list to a file and adds a new line at the end.
+ The script boilerplate.py shows a template program.
+ The script MyExampleScript.py shows an example of writing code into a script and running it instead of pasting or sending code to the Python command prompt.
+ The script basic_csv.py reads a file containing 'Species','Infraorder','Family','Distribution','Body mass male (Kg)' and writes a file containing only species name and Body mass.
All the scripts can be easily run with the python command and correct script name.
