# CMEECourseWork Week2
## Brief description
The week2 directory is organized with code, data, results, sandbox, README.md, and .gitignore. There are a few data files downloaded from the [TheMulQuaBio repository](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio) in the data directory. 
The sandbox directory includes several test files.
The code directory contains a number of important scripts for the practicals in [Python I chapter](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/05-Python_I.html#practicals).


## Languages
The language used in week2 is python.

## Dependencies
There are many useful python packages available in standard libraries, they can be explicitly installed using "sudo apt install python-packagename". For week2 section, sys and csv packages need to be installed. 

## Installation
Details for Python packages can be found on the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). 

## Project structure and Usage
The week2 part includes code, data, results, sandbox. There are some python scripts in the code directory.
+ The script lc1.py can create three different lists containing the latin names, common names and mean body masses for each species in birds, respectively.
+ The script lc2.py can create a list of month, rainfall tuples where the amount of rain was greater than 100 mm and just month names where the amount of rain was less than 50 mm. 
+ The script tuple.py can print latin name, common name, mass of birds on a separate line or output block by species. 
+ The script dictionary.py can populate a dictionary called taxa_dic derived from taxa so that it maps order names to sets of taxa.
+ The script cfexercises1.py has six useful functions to implement different calculations.
+ The script align_seqs.py can take the DNA sequences as an input from a single csv file and save the best alignment along with its corresponding score in a single text file.
+ The script align_seqs_fasta.py can take any two fasta sequences in separate files to be aligned as input.
+ The script align_seqs_better.py can record and save all the equally-best alignments. 
All the scripts can be easily run with the python command and correct script name.
