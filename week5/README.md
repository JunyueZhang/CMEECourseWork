# CMEECourseWork Week5
## Brief description
The week5 directory is organized with code, data, results, and sandbox. There are some data files in the data directory. 
The sandbox directory and results directory are used to store test scripts and results for the scripts in the code directory, respectively.
The code directory contains three Rscripts about GIS and spatial methods in R.
Before running the scripts, there is a long list of packages requested to be installed: raster, sf, sp, rgeos, rgdal, lwgeom, dismo, ncf, SpatialPack, spdep, spatialreg, nlme, spgwr, and spmoran.

## Languages

## Project structure and Usage
The week5 part includes code, data, results, and sandbox. There are three R scripts in the code directory.
+ The Practical_One.R script is about GIS data and plotting.
