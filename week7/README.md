# CMEECourseWork Week7
## Brief description
The week7 directory is organized with code, data, results, sandbox, README.md, and .gitignore. There are a few data files downloaded from the [TheMulQuaBio repository](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio) as required in the data directory. 
The sandbox directory and results directory are used to store test scripts and results for the scripts in the code directory, respectively.
The code directory contains a number of important python scripts for the  [Python I chapter](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/05-Python_I.html#id2) and [Python II chapter](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/06-Python_II.html#practicals).
**And there are some Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, csv, sys, doctest, subprocess, timeit, time) needed to be imported before running the scripts**.

## Languages
The language used in week7 is Python.

## Dependencies
For the week7 section, there are a number of useful Python packages **(numpy, scipy, matplotlib, csv, sys, doctest, subprocess, timeit, time)** needed to be imported. 

## Installation
Some useful Python packages are available as standard libraries and can be easily imported from within python or ipython, other packages are accessible by explicitly installing them using "sudo apt install python-packagename" or by using pip. 

## Project structure and Usage
The week7 part includes code, data, results, and sandbox. There are a number of Python scripts in the code directory.
+ The LV1.py script generates two figures about Consumer-Resource population dynamics for the Lotka-Volterra (LV) model. 
+ The oaks_debugme.py script modifies doctests appropriately and the script such that it can handle cases where there is a typo (such as ‘Quercuss’) or there is a genus name that is not strictly ‘Quercus’.
+ The profileme.py script includes several functions to show profiling the code and locating the sections of the code where speed bottlenecks exist.
+ The profileme2.py script tries an alternative approach to write the illustrative program.
+ The MyFirstJupyterNb.ipynb script shows a simple Jupyter program.
+ The TestR.py script and TestR.R script create a simple program to illustrate running R from Python easily.
+ The timeitme.py script uses the timeit module to figure out the best way to do something specific as part of a larger program (say a particular command or a loop).
+ The grp_oaks_debugme.py script excludes the header row in its search for oaks in a given dataset and includes the column headers ("Genus", "species").  All the scripts can be easily run with the correct command and script name.
